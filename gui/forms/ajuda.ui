It will be "live" only the cases we know based on carbon? or life is a broader definition that would cover any process capable of replicating itself, evolve and persist? &lt;br />This project was not created to answer these philosophical questions, but to demonstrate more clearly possible that the process of evolution of life which we know - natural selection (Darwin) - but can be simulated on the computer. Surely that the complexity and breadth of the system are limited due to very limited computer existing today, however, is still clearly the evolution of life before their eyes. &lt;br />To make things more "rapid" that the real world where the genetic improvements occur in ancient scales of time, the creatures in this simulator - called "Biotas" - are the owners of a relatively small genetic code, which allows changes in features evidêntes also at life cycles are short and therefore accelerating the generations adaptive genetic changes. &lt;br />One is a Biota be interesting. It is virtual, in fact, is a set of bytes - you can call it something "alive"? -- You can draw a simple set of atoms of something "alive"?. The Biotas has only one goal in life since birth: reproduce, in other words, pass their genes on. This should be done with urgent priority since his time of life is limited, the Biotas get with increasing inefficiency with age until they fail to sustain their lives more and die. &lt;br />The only measure of health of a Biota is the amount of energy, the figure is zero when he dies, and in return, when he reaches a certain threshold set by their genes it creates a child (asexual reproduction). When her son's father donates certain percentage of their energy, also determined by genes. &lt;br />The Biotas to reach its threshold of reproduction and pass their genes on to need more energy. This is done running behind small grains of blue energy that provide a generous amount of energy to those who eat it. Meanwhile, grains are often scarce and appear in random places, indeed in most cases there are more than Biotas grains in the system, this means that when you have to find a grain it competed with other Biota. &lt;br />The Biotas, grains need to get swimming, swimming and consumes energy, so it is best that all energy used by swimming grain compensate for the energy it provides. There are endless configurations anatomical and behavioral possible for a Biota, some are making it extremely ineficiêntes spend kilos of energy to swim a few centimetres, other settings simply do not leave the place ... Only a small portion of these permits to achieve a kind swimming behind grains, add energy, reproduce and pass their genes on to their children do the same and so on. &lt;br />Each reproduction there is a likelihood of a genetic mutation occur randomly in any gene of the child, since the mutations affect the movement of swimming, weights and segments of the head, length, energy threshold that activates the reproduction and several other genes. A mutation - among Biotas - is not very well view, this often why the mutants are being picky and with variations to them atrapalha life. They can not compete for food and have children and end up dying, their children - if - also will not have a much better future. Nevertheless, some changes give lucky mutated slightly higher skills than their parents, is guaranteed an advantage in spending less energy to swim, or a higher speed, or a setting more precise parameters of behavior. This feature allows you to have more children, and they also more children, competing against other poor Biotas lower and subjulgando other races, unless they also have their "mutants". &lt;br />Finally, if generations and generations pass, and you can see an increase in efficiency and adaptation of Biotas the characteristics of the environment. You can save the genes of a biota in a file and upload it later in another simulation to analyze the effect of the introduction of the species. Walls can be created in the environment create "geographic insulation" between animals. True wars are fought between biological species in the area of niche that share. &lt;br />You can find out a lot with the SimVidA. To analyze trends on the parameters of the world that you set, saving genetic patterns successful and competitive them, cloning, mutar, killing the will without weight in consciousness. Arquitetar schemes walls that act as farm Biotas, creating species for specific purposes and what more your imagination allows.&lt;/p>&lt;/td>&lt;/tr>&lt;/table>&lt;/body>&lt;/html></string>
